#   Rational

Accurately recreate the visuals found: https://www.figma.com/file/MrZR9TZOVrI8pwBjJuDprZ/Code-Review-Template in code.

The focus should be on the element named "Listings Feed" (found via the left column) which contains the main vehicle cards.
Consider the design as it changes breakpoint, the site content widths and the responsive nature of the design.
Whilst there is no need to recreate the other elements on the page (e.g. site header/footer or side filters) you should consider their positioning and how they interact with your work (TIP: using placeholder elements just to fill those spaces might be a good idea)


#   Requirements

Clean, semantic and accessible CSS and HTML, written to best practices.  Assume only the latest browser support required (no IE).
Use GitHub to track changes and commit your code to.  There is an example of vehicle data at the end of this doc if you want to use it which represents typical response data from the api.


#   Tools

As we develop using Nuxt (Vue), ideally use this way of working but generally feel free to achieve this in the way you normally work or in a way you think will deliver the best results.
There is no wrong or right way here and please don't think of this is a "test", it is simply to see how you structure your code and how you accurately you create the UI.


#   Timescales

This is not a timed challenge but please be aware that under normal circumstances work like this would be estimated and resourced accordingly.
Please try to push complete work within a few days, if you are unable to complete within this time please get in touch and make us aware.
Don't spend a ton of time on this, we just want to get an impression of how you code and your accuracy.


#   Questions

Feel free to contact me with any questions, any time, at rob.dillon@nexuspoint.co.uk


#   Completion

If needed please ensure there are adequate instructions to build/run the work. Once complete please email me and we'll organise sharing/etc




##  JSON (example)

Below is a typical example of the data returned from the api for a single vehicle (note: finance is done separately).  If you prefer to use any of this data feel free to do so.
